                        This project is a web application that provides real-time and historical data analysis for cryptocurrencies, including <strong>Bitcoin</strong>, <strong>Ethereum</strong>, and <strong>Tether</strong>. 
                        It uses <em>Flask</em> for the web interface, <em>SQLAlchemy</em> for database management, and <em>Plotly</em> for visualizing data.
                    </p>

                            <strong>Note:</strong> This project is hosted on the free tier of Render, which may result in slower page load times. Additionally, crypto data cannot be updated via Cron Job, so it is manually updated periodically. Thank you for your patience!

                        Recipes Project is a web application designed for managing my favorite recipes. Users can add new recipes, view details of existing ones <em>(with images fetched from an API)</em>, and delete recipes.
